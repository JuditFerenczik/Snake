# Snake
Snake python version


A classical mobile game's python version. You can use the arrows of your keyboard to move the snake. Be careful not to touch the walls otherwise you will die!
Try to eat as many food as possible but with each food the length of the snake grows and the speed increases. The previous record is on the top of the screen.
